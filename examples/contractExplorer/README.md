# Contract Explorer

This is a complete example of an application. It uses `eosjs` to submit actions
to the blockchain. You can see the deployed app here: https://elm-eos-demo.netlify.app/.

## Getting started

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm install

npm run generate

npm run dev
```

To build the app:

```bash

npm run generate

npm run build
```

You can then open `public/index.html` in your browser to view the app.
